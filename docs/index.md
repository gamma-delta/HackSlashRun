# Hack Slash Run: A split-play RPG about breaking into places, hacking, and leaving no trace.

There are two types of player:

*   **RUNNERS** do "traditional" RPG things: running around, attacking, interacting with the real world. During a mission, they're the ones inside the building.
*   **HACKERS** doâ€¦ hacking. Once they've gained access to a network, they use their programming skills to edit the world favorably for the Runners. During a mission, they sit in an inconspicous van outside, chuckle, and say "I'm in."

# SHARED RULES
These rules are shared between Runners and Hackers.

## Missions
Missions are sort of like the dungeons of a more traditional RPG. There is an unknown location, enemies, traps, and an objective.

Before you start a mission, it's assumed you've had ample downtime to rest and recover HP, get a little info about the site, and buy stuff. (In other words,you don't have to role-play it. The game really only takes place inside missions.)

During a mission, the Runners have to find a way inside the building, manuever around, evade or fight guards, etc. The amount of "hacking" they do is generally limited to finding passwords written down somewhere or plugging in pre-written scripts on USB sticks into mainframes.

The Hackers sit outside and disable security cameras, jam guard weapons, call elevators, etc. As the hacker isn't in the building and can't directly help the runners, they usually have to rely on their creativity to manipulate situations to the team's favor.

## Winning and Losing

To win a mission, complete the objective! It's that simple.

There are a few ways to lose a mission:

*   Some missions might have a designated failure condition: if you break it, you lose.
*   If everyone dies, you lose.
*   The police might show up.

### The Police
~~Sending out an SOS to the world...~~

Whenever a player fails a Charisma check, the team gets one *strike*. When the number of strikes exceeds the *tolerance* of the mission, the police get called. Whoever failed the Charisma check that initiated calling the police makes another Charisma check, and records the number rolled. The players now have that many turns to complete the mission, or the police arrive, arrest you, and lose you the mission.

## Miscellaneous
When dividing a number, always round up.

# RUNNERS

Runners are the people inside the building. They have timed turns, and physically interact with people and objects inside the building.

They do more "traditional" RPG roles: they have stats and make checks, sneak around, disable alarms, and incapacitate guards.

See [the complete rules for runners.](runners.md)

# HACKERS

Hackers are not affected by the 30-second turn timer, do not enter the mission site, and do not have stats. Instead, they manipulate network-enabled devices, such as lights, elevators, and servers.

The only thing keeping them back is usually just their knowlege (or lack of knowlege) of the internals of the site.
