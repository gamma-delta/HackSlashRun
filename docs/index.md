# Hack Slash Run: A split-play RPG about breaking into places, hacking, and leaving no trace.

There are two types of player:

*   **RUNNERS** do "traditional" RPG things: running around, attacking, interacting with the real world. During a mission, they're the ones inside the building.
*   **HACKERS** doâ€¦ hacking. Once they've gained access to a network, they use their programming skills to edit the world favorably for the Runners. During a mission, they sit in an inconspicous van outside, chuckle, and say "I'm in."

# Missions
Missions are sort of like the dungeons of a more traditional RPG. There is an unknown location, enemies, traps, and an objective.

# RUNNERS

Runners are the people inside the building. They have timed turns, and physically interact with people and objects inside the building.

They do more "traditional" RPG roles: they have stats and make checks, sneak around, disable alarms, and incapacitate guards.

# HACKERS

Hackers are not affected by the 30-second turn timer, do not enter the mission site, and do not have stats. Instead, they manipulate network-enabled devices, such as lights, elevators, and servers.

The only thing keeping them back is usually just their knowlege (or lack of knowlege) of the internals of the site.

# Miscellaneous
When dividing a number, always round up.
