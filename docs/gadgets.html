    <h1>Gadgets</h1>
    <p>What would a spy team be without gadgets? Here are some cool gadgets a runner might have or find to help them out during a mission.</p>

    <h2>Card Copier</h2>
    <p>This assembly consists of a coil of wire and a blank card. By standing in the same square as an RFID card (such as most ID or pass cards) for <strong>3 seconds</strong>, there's a 50% chance that the information on that card gets copied to the blank card.</p>
    <p>Once the card is copied, the blank card won't get overwritten. It takes <strong>1 second</strong> to wipe the card so a new card can be copied.</p>

    <h2>Canned Air</h2>
    <p>Just office-standard canned air. However, if the can is held upside-down before using, it produces a whitish smoke in addition to the air. This smoke can be used to open motion-operated doors from the other side. (DEX check, DC is whatever the door usually is minus 5.)</p>
    <p>To use it normally takes 1 second. To open a door takes 2 seconds.</p>
    <p>It has 20 uses when bought new. When found, it has 3d6 uses.</p>

    <h2>Night Vision Goggles</h2>
    <p>Night vision goggles let you see in the dark when they're on. While wearing them when they're on, you don't get any disadvantages while in the dark. However, you have disadvantage on checks made to see in the light while you're wearing them and they're on.</p>
    <p>It takes <strong>3 seconds</strong> to turn them on or off, as they power on or off.</p>
    <p>Night vision goggles are enourmously bulky and conspicuous. You have disadvantage on Charisma checks made to convince people that you are authorised somewhere while wearing them.</p>
