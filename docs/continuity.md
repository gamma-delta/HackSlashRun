# Continutity

Here are a couple companies and brands, some real, some fictional. I use them to provide a sense of continuity to the world of Hack Slash Run.

## Yamaha
Just like in the real world, Yamaha makes everything from motorcycles to cowbells. They're a Japanese company but most of their devices are translated pretty well.

## Akea
The fictional Akea makes industrial-strength devices like heating/cooling systems or forklifts. They are known for being really cheap, and not requiring much maintenance. However, they usually don't work the greatest. Akea's a Chinese company, so most of their documentation is in Chinese or horribly translated English.

## Protek
Protek, another fictional company, makes defense systems. They are famous for motion detectors, card locks, security cameras, that sort of thing. Recently, they've rolled out a new system for automatically tallying and accounting for shots taken from "smart firearms" connected to a wi-fi network, removing a lot of tedious paperwork.

They're an American company.
