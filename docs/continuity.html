    <h1>Continutity</h1>
    <p>Here are a couple companies and brands, some real, some fictional. I use them to provide a sense of continuity to the world of Hack Slash Run.</p>

    <h2>Yamaha</h2>
    <p>Just like in the real world, Yamaha makes everything from motorcycles to cowbells. They're a Japanese company but most of their devices are translated pretty well.</p>

    <h2>Akea</h2>
    <p>The fictional Akea makes industrial-strength devices like heating/cooling systems or forklifts. They are known for being really cheap, and not requiring much maintinence. However, they usually don't work the greatest. Akea's a Chinese company, so most of their documentation is in Chinese or horribly translated English.</p>

    <h2>Protek</h2>
    <p>Protek, another fictional company, makes defense systems. They are famous for motion detectors, card locks, security cameras, that sort of thing. Recently, they've rolled out a new system for automatically tallying and accounting for shots taken from "smart firearms" connected to a wi-fi network, removing a lot of tedious paperwork.</p>
    <p>They're an American company.</p>
