# MISSIONS

During a mission, the Runners have to find a way inside the building, manuever around, evade or fight guards, etc. The amount of "hacking" they do is generally limited to finding passwords written down somewhere or plugging in pre-written scripts on USB sticks into mainframes.

The Hackers sit outside and unlock doors, jam guard weapons, call elevators, etc. As the hacker isn't in the building and can't directly help the runners, they usually have to rely on their creativity to manipulate situations to the team's favor.

Before you start a mission, it's assumed you've had ample downtime to rest and recover HP, get a little info about the site, and buy stuff. (In other words, you don't have to role-play it. The game really only takes place inside missions.)

# Winning and Losing

This wouldn't be much of a game without a way to win or lose, would it?

## Winning

To win a mission, complete the objective and leave the building! It's that simple. Objectives might be simple, like "access this terminal," or they might be complex, like "destroy some equipment and make sure it looks like one of the guards did it."

You don't know whether you've won or lost until after every player leaves the building.

## Losing

There are a few ways to lose a mission:

*   Some missions might have a designated failure condition: if you break it, you lose.
*   If everyone dies, you lose.
*   The police might show up.

### The Police
~~Sending out an SOS to the world...~~

Whenever a player fails a Charisma check, the team gets one *strike*. When the number of strikes exceeds the *tolerance* of the mission, the police get called. Whoever failed the Charisma check that initiated calling the police makes another Charisma check, and records the number rolled. The players now have that many turns to complete the mission, or the police arrive, arrest you, and lose you the mission.
